If you fix the cause of the error (such as refreshing the Field Mapping tab and map the new fields): ALM Octane Synchronizer will re-synchronize those records if changes in the actual record are detected.ALM Octane Synchronizer also periodically re-synchronizes all records: including those that had run with errors: but have had no subsequent changes.To ensure that records that ran with errors are re-synchronized in the next upcoming run: manually set the link to re-synchronize those records.For details: see Re-synchronizing records with fixed errors (automatic mode only).</td>
