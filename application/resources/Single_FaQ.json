      "question": "I only see the source file and line number where the issue exists. How can I tell where the attack is coming from",
      "answer": "Each cross-site scripting flaw in the Veracode service carries two types of information: the location at which the flaw is exposed to the end user: and the data or control flow through which a tainted attack string travels to reach the vulnerable part of the code. You can view this control flow in the Call Stack view"

      "question": "Why does my run history show updated records when I did not update any records: but only created records",

    },
    {
      "category": "Octane",
      "question": "So: for example: when you create a record in ALM and synchronize it to ALM Octane: that new record is created in ALM Octane: and assigned an ALM Octane ID.",
      "answer": "ALM Octane Synchronizer recognizes this new ID field value: and sends it back to ALM: adding it to the source record.This last step is the update you see in your run history."
    },
    {
      "category": "Octane",
      "question": "I modified my link to fix errors that occurred in previous synchronizations. Why do I see these same errors occurring again",
      "answer": "If your link is in automatic mode: and a synchronization ran with errors: the records with errors are not necessarily fixed in subsequent runs.This may happen if the errors occurred because of changes outside of the link configuration: such as if the schema changed: but the field mapping was not updated. If you fix the cause of the error (such as refreshing the Field Mapping tab and map the new fields): ALM Octane Synchronizer will re-synchronize those records if changes in the actual record are detected.ALM Octane Synchronizer also periodically re-synchronizes all records: including those that had run with errors: but have had no subsequent changes.To ensure that records that ran with errors are re-synchronized in the next upcoming run: manually set the link to re-synchronize those records.For details: see Re-synchronizing records with fixed errors (automatic mode only)."

    {
      "category": "Octane",
      "question": "Synchronization failed due to unmapped users. What should I do",
      "answer": "When synchronization fails because of unmapped users: check if the missing users exist. If they do not: you can create them in ALM Octane (either as active users: or inactive). When you run synchronization again: the ALM users that were missing will be mapped to the newly-created users in ALM Octane. For details on adding or activating users in ALM Octane: see Assign roles and permissions and Assign roles and permissions."

The list of missing fields is displayed in the UI.Edit the relevant link within the Synchronizer UI: and click Refresh fields and field values in the Field mapping tab. All the removed fields will be removed from field mapping. Run an integrity check to verify that records will be synchronized correctly."

      "question": "During synchronization I received an error: Some of the fields used in the filter were deleted from ALM Octane.",
      "answer": "This error indicates that you removed user defined fields from ALM Octane: which were used in a Synchronizer filter within a particular synchronization link.Either edit the existing filter: or create a new filter without the user defined fields that no longer exist. If you create a new filter: within the Synchronizer UI edit the appropriate link and change the Synchronizer filter in the General tab. Run an integrity check to verify that records will be synchronized correctly."

    {
      "category": "Octane",
      "question": "Why is the synchronization adding attachments named attachment.url to the ALM Octane entities",
      "answer": "This may happen if an ALM entity has an attachment whose name contains special characters (~!@#$%()^&).Workaround: On ALM Octane: remove the added attachment. On ALM: rename the attachment so that it does not contain special characters."
